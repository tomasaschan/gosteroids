# Here we go!

I'm starting a new adventure!

Ron Jeffries' has been writing an [article series] about the ways you can shape and re-shape a code base, using the Asteroids arcade game as his lump of clay. I find some of the design decisions he's making interesting enough to want to try them out myself, and I have fond memories of playing (probably a very modern version of) Asteroids on the computer at my grandparents' house when I was little, so I think it would be fun to follow along in my own code base.

To challenge myself, I'm not going to use the same tech stack as Ron - he's done it once in Kotlin, and is now doing it in Python; I will use Golang. I'm relatively familiar with Golang since before, and I have (ages ago!) done quite a bit of simulating physics back in uni, but I have never attempted game development, so that'll be interesting.

Also, I'm starting this adventure in a rare break during my parental leave, so expect irregular and infrequent updates. The most likely outcome is that I burst out a few iterations here, then nothing happens for months, and then I either pick it up again or decide it's abandoned. I state this here, so that you can't hold it against me later.

That said, let's begin!
